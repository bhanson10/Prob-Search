# Prob-Search
The "Prob-Search" repsository containes the codebase accompying the paper "An extensible framework for Probabilistic Search for stationary 
or randomly-moving targets characterized by super-Gaussian or experimentally-defined Regions of Interest (ROI)" published in ___. Below is an in-depth summary
explaining the proper usage of all the software included in said repository. In all, the codebase provides the computational framework necessary
to: <br> <br>
&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; 1. Generate the relaxation advection field that drives an arbitrary PDF to a steady-state shape for either analytical or numerical PDFs <br>
&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; 2. Drive said arbitrary PDF using the relaxation advection field and isotropic diffusion (as well as create animations of this process) <br>
&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; 3. Use the relaxaction advection field to perform a non-evasive search process with _n_ search vehicles on varying orbits <br>
&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; 4. Use the relaxaction advection field plus an additional field function to perform an evasive search process with _n_ search vehicles on varying orbits <br>

## relaxation_advection.m
The purpose of _relaxation_advection.m_ is to achieve Objective 1 and 2, generating the relaxation advection field for analytical and numerical PDFs and demonstrating that the relaxation advection field does as it should by driving an arbitrary PDF with it. We begin by generating an initial PDF to use as our test case. The following are possible options for initial PDFs: <br>

&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; 1. **Gaussian/super-Gaussians** <br>
&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; - Parameters that may be varied: <br>
&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; * _xvbar_: Mean of Gaussian/super-Gaussian <br>
&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; * _P_: covariance of Gaussian/super-Gaussian <br>
&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; * _s_: order of Gaussian/super-Gaussian (s>1 is considered a super-Gaussian in this context)<br>
&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; 2. **Kidney Bean** <br>
&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; - This PDF is a fairly rigid example, meant to demonstrate a PDF that is shaped like a kidney bean. For this reason, changing the default parameters may cause problems <br>
&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; 3. **Numerical PDFs** <br>
&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; - This implementation takes a set of data points and creates a PDF out of them via the alpha-convex hull implementation or kernel density estimation. Change the _flag_ parameter to choose between the three provided datasets (information explaining each of the datasets throughouly can be found in the paper) or generate your own dataset via _create_dataset.m_. <br>

Some other paramters that are available for changing are: <br>
&ensp; &ensp; - _dt_: time step of the simulation <br>
&ensp; &ensp; - _N_: number of grid cells in one dimension of the _NxN_ grid <br>
&ensp; &ensp; - _L_: length and width of the grid <br>
&ensp; &ensp; - _lambda_: homogenous isotropic diffusion constant, such that _D=lambda*I_ <br><br>

To choose one of these specific PDF options, comment out the other instances that call new PDFs. Once the initial PDF is chosen, the code generates the relaxation advection field in the _x_ and _y_ directions, each an _NxN_ grid with the advection value at the grid center. The next step generates a uniform PDF of the same size _PDF_U_ and propagates that PDF using the relaxation advection field and homogeneous isotropic diffusion until convergence (convergence is explain in the paper). The _create_video_ function combines all of the frames generated by the code into a single .MP4.
