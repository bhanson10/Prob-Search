# Prob-Search
The "Prob-Search" repsository containes the codebase accompying the paper "An extensible framework for Probabilistic Search for stationary 
or randomly-moving targets characterized by super-Gaussian or experimentally-defined Regions of Interest (ROI)". Below is an in-depth summary
explaining the proper usage of all the software included in said repository. In all, the codebase provides the computational framework necessary
to:
